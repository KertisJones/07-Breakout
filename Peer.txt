What is something you learned by reviewing your peer’s project?
	His code showed me how to connect sounds to specific events like dying or hitting a block. 
	I could figure out how to make music play in the background, but I couldn't figure out how to work sound effects.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is something you saw in your peer’s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
 	Particles. I thought it was really cool that he made the blocks crumble into pieces when the player hits them,
	and I wouldn't mind trying to do something like that in my own code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code? 
	I think what he did was really consise and well done. Most all of the more difficult code was commmented well,
	which made it easier to read and understand. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What could have been clearer or better commented?
 	Most everything was commented well except for the last bit. The "if __name__ == '__main__':" bit. I don't really
	know what it does and there are no comments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
 	The only thing that really confused me where the particles. It looked really involved, and I'm not 
	always the best when it comes to math.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
 	Again, his README was also written really well. There aren't many things that I would change about his assignment. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
	You did an amazing job with everything you incorporated into this assignment. Maybe one of these days, I'll be 
	able to understand how you made those particles work. haha
